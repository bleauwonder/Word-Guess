# Word Guess Game (Browser)

<!-- I have completed everything in the text to create an interactive word guess game. -->

## Overview

<!-- 
For this assignment, I had to follow a series of precise directives to add certain functions and html id's to create a Word Guess game that a user can interact with.

My theme is "Aliens in Pop Culture" words.

My approach was to follow the instructions in order, starting with the functions. I worked a lot with fellow classmates to find solutions to each step of the process, from the logic, to the input/output.
