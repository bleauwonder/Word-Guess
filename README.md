# Word Guess Game (Browser)

## **This is an interactive word guess game!**

## Overview
 
### For this assignment, I had to follow a series of precise directives to add certain functions and html id's to create a Word Guess game that a user can interact with. I started with writing all the functions for the logic of the game first, then create the HTML and CSS, then add input/output.

### My theme is "Aliens in Pop Culture" words.

### My approach was to follow the instructions in order, starting with the functions. I worked a lot with fellow classmates to find solutions to each step of the process, from the logic, to the input/output.
### Additionally, this is my extra specific pseudo-code for the input/output.
### Input pseudo-code
#### When the user presses a key for a letter guess:
#### puzzleState should search the word to see if the guessed letter is in the word. #### if letter is in the word, update puzzleState to replace blank/show letter, update guessesLeft by -1
#### if letter is not in the word, no update to puzzleState, update guessesLeft by -1, update wrong guesses by +1
