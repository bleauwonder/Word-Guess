# Alien Word Guess Game

## **Interactive word guess game!**
 
### For this assignment, I had to follow a series of precise directives to add certain functions and html id's to create a Word Guess game that a user can interact with. I started with writing all the functions for the logic of the game first, then create the HTML and CSS, then add input/output.

### My theme is "Aliens in Pop Culture" words.

### My approach was to follow the instructions in order, starting with the functions. I worked a lot with fellow classmates to find solutions to each step of the process, from the logic, to the input/output because this was our first foray into creating functions for javascript.
